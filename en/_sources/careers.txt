        making Tarantool the best-known as well as the best. The product is in
        production use within many small and large companies, as well as within
        Mail.Ru itself.

        The features include sharding, replication, write-ahead logging, a
        variety of journal log options, load balancing, Lua stored procedures,
        connectors for C, Perl, PHP and Python, modules for interaction with

          Sometimes we contribute to other related open-source projects (LuaJIT,
          libev). Tarantool developers give talks at top IT conferences (both in
          Russia and abroad), regularly publish specialized articles, hold
          workshops and even author a technology podcast (devopsdeflope.ru).

          Apart from our involvement in the open-source community, we’ve started
          selling Tarantool-based solutions to other companies. We’re looking

            testing;
          * deploy project to production;
          * work with the open-source community (project’s full source code is
            available on github.com).

          **Requirements:**

          * good knowledge of any modern scripting language (Python, Go,
            Node.js, Lua and so on);
          * interest in and eagerness to develop high-load projects;
          * 3+ years of experience of commercial software development;
          * experience designing and developing a REST API;

          * participation in any open source project;
          * advanced English;
          * basic knowledge of JavaScript and experience with any of these
            technologies: jQuery, AngularJS, Backbone.js, React;
          * any experience with C/C++ (most team members are C/C++ developers).

          **What we offer:**

          * **comfortable work environment:** large open-space office,
            sound-absorbing panels, tens of conference rooms, extra monitors,
            powerful hardware and MacBooks, if needed;
          * **tasty food:** the office has a restaurant offering breakfasts and
            lunches, and two kitchenettes on each floor, where you can always
            find some fruit, berries, tea, coffee, Coca-Cola and, sure enough,
            cookies;
          * **leisure with pleasure:** spacious lounge zone, massage chairs,
            fresh juice bar, swings, cosy corners with comforters and pillows

            training sessions and various developer events: Moscow.pm,
            CocoaHeads Moscow, UX Wednesday and the like. It goes without
            saying that we send our employees to external professional events
            as well.

          We’ll be happy to review your application and, given mutual interest,
          make you a very tempting offer.

          from the issuance date. Being a certified Tarantool developer gives you
          a chance to get hired by one of our partners, either by directly
          contacting them or through our assistance. Some of our partners are
          currently willing to employ such specialists. After receiving the
          certificate, you may ask us to negotiate, on your behalf, your desired
          salary or hourly rate with a prospective employer. We’ll recommend that
          our partner pay you a specified amount. This process is totally free and
          transparent.
